          <p class="lead">
            Students at Christ's are pursuing an incredible variety of interests across
            almost every academic discipline that you can think of. Why do people and 
            animals get addicted to things? How do plants tell the time? How did ancient 
            kings rule their empires? These are just three of the questions that members
            of our MCR are trying to answer as they pursue research at Cambridge.
            On this page you can explore some of the events run by the MCR to enable 
            students here to communicate their research.

        <h3>ERSS</span></h3>
        <p class="lead">The Emerging Research Seminar Series is the flagship academic event run by the MCR.
            It is a multidisciplinary event open to the MCR members or Fellows of the College.
            There are four events each year, one during each term and one in the summer vacation, 
            and every event consists of three talks - two by graduate students and one by
           A Fellow of the college.
           <br /> Speaking at the ERSS is a great opportunity to present your work to an interested 
           audience outside of your department. For more information click <a href="http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/current-students/research-seminars">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Talks</span></h3>
        <p class="lead">Alongside the ERSS, we run a number of different kinds of talks. 
          <a href="http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/current-students/programmes">Library events</a> see
          graduate students present talks in the Bodley Library (or the 'Old' Library as it's
          better known to student) which are connected to the changing exhibitions created by 
          the library staff. We are also planning to introduce a series of informal talks - for instance
          a brief presentation to accompany a movie night, or a roundtable discussion of ongoing research.</p>

        <h3>Teaching</span></h3>
        <p class="lead">A number of MCR members are employed by various colleges and faculties to teach
          undergraduates. To help develop the teaching skills of members, the MCR runs a 
          Teaching Workshop which meets a couple of times each term. The sessions are 
          multi-disciplinary and provide a forum to discuss difficulties that arise in the course
          of supervising and to develop new strategies for teaching. We are also hoping to tie
          this in to the programme of talks that we run in the hope of allowing participants
          to develop presentation and lecturing skills.</p>

        <a name="engagement"></a>
        <h3>Engagement</span></h3>
        <p class="lead">Research should never just sit within the confines of your own mind.
          There's no point doing research if you don't attempt to communicate it. The MCR is looking
          to expand the participation of our students in the public engagement activities run by
          the university. We will be running our own training days and events and this page will soon
          be updated with information about how you can get involved in the exciting things
          going on within the university as a whole.</p>
